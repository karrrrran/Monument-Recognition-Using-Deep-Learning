# Monument Recognition using Deep Neural Networks

The aim of this project is to classify the famous Indian Monuments across the Golden Quadrilateral. The Inception v3 deep neural network architecture has been adopted and transfer learning has been implemented to reduce the computational load.

## Dataset

The dataset was generated by using the Selenium webdriver as a web-crawler. Close to 400 images were extracted for each monument and the non-relevant images (which were minimal) were then filtered out manually. 

## Workflow

### 1. Generating the training and test dataset 

As mentioned above.

### 2. Retraining the last layer of the Neural Network

The salient feature of this Transfer learning model is that we insert our training set and retrain only the final layer of the Inception model,while leaving the other layers untouched. This is very advantageous as this gives the user the ability to train this model without the requirement of a GPU which is predominantly required when training a dataset consisting of images. The training script will remove the old top layer and it will train a new one on the basis of the training set provided. None of the Monument images will be present in the original class of images on which the entire network was trained on. Once the bottlenecks have been created, the image dataset is set for training.
